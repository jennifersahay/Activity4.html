<h2> MYSELF</h2>

<p>
I am Jennifer N. Sahay<br>
Taking up BSIT in Cavite State University - Main Campus<br>
Currently residing in Bacoor City Cavite<br>
I grew up in a broken family, but still my life is not a mess.<br>
I learned how to take care of myself in a young age, I learned to be contended on what I have.<br>
You might thought that my childhood life is not enjoyable , but I learned how to look in the possitive side.<br>
</p>

<p>

My father is a Truck Driver, he is delivering cement from Bacoor to Pampanga.<br>
My mother has her own family and they are living fine.<br>
I have to older siblings and they have their own family , so I am the only that<br>
 is leaving together with our father<br>
